            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>Honestly I'm still figuring that out, so for now I'll just say that I'm a student for simplicity's sake</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h2>Why did I make this site</h2>
            <p>I wanted to try my skills at html and css (probably javascript soon too)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h2>How long have I used html and css for</h2>
            <p>I started around 2 August 2020, since then I've been doing it on and off, I still suck at it tho lol</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <h2>Did I have any other projects besides this?</h2>
            <p>Yes actually, currently the only ""semi-serious"" projects are the previous version of this site and a discord bot which I'm hosting using heroku </p>

            <p>Rhythm games have a special place in my heart, as many, I started out with Guitar hero, but my first ever real rhythm game I'd have to say would be osu!mania, currently I'm almost #76k globally. Though I also play other ones such as chunithm, maimai, BPM, muse dash, necrodancer and so on and so on. </p>

            <p>Minecraft is a game which I've been acquainted with for well over 10 years now, I have around 5000 hours in it, seeing as I've been playing the game since 2012 that's not really surprising, I mostly did PVP but now I don't play as much, and while I'm still decent, I wouldn't say anywhere near as good as I was.</p>
