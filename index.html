            WELCOME TO THE <strong><em>NUCLEAR TESTING GROUNDS</em></strong> (property of Memerguyy)</p>
            As the name suggests I use this as, basically my nuclear testing grounds, why's it called that?
            Well it's because I know one day I'm gonna do somthing so stupid that it's gonna be considered nuclear (at least for this website lol)</p>
