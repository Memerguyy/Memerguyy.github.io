                        <p>Muse dash is genuinely, one of my favourite non-4k, non-VSRG rhythm games, something which I love about it <i>aside from the graphics and the general gameplay of it</i> is the pricing model it uses, you buy a single DLC and receive updates indefinitely (or until the game's lifespan ends)<br><br>Of course, this DOES cause the game's price to inflate overtime but that's to be expected since, more content = higher price, but honestly that DLC was worth every single penny I spent on it</p>

                        <p>God this game... this game has a large history with me that I won't be able to fit into this tiny-ass box, however, what I can fit into this game is my recommendation for this game. If I were to pick ANY game out of all the ones mentioned here for someone to play, it would be this. CoTND is a <i>relatively</i> beginner friendly game, it starts off slow, and is pretty short at the beginning, but as you delve deeper, the game spikes in difficulty <br><br> Base game? Yeah that took me probably a total of 3-4 hours to beat. <br><br>And when I started trying to beat it with other characters? Yeah good-fucking-luck with that lol. But as cruel as I'm making CoTND seem to be, it's a blast of a roguelike, it takes the best from a rhythm game stand point, the best from a roguelike standpoint, and mushes them in together into this beautiful concoction of a game</p>

                    <p>Oh my GOD!!! It is time for me to finally talk about one of my most favourite, most UNDERRATED games of all time, that game? Everhood!!! The best way to describe it would be <b>"Rhythm game undertale but you took LSD and shrooms before playing"</b>, this game is a whole expirience, from the intricate lore, to the fighting system, to the multiple endings, to the merch, workshop, mods; community; custom levels; you name it and everhood has it!!!! <br><br>Even though I'm done with this game already, I still come back to it every once in a while, still haven't gotten around to doing 100% achievements so I might just try that, the game can either be INSANELY difficult or a fun casual expirience, whichever one your heart desires. <br><br>Honestly? This game is so damn good, I'll even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229380/Everhood/" style="z-index: 999999 !important;">link it for you</a>, yes! Just for you! And for no one else :) <s>(pay no mind to the fact this is a public website)</s>. Just click the toggle text button to make text selectable and go buy the game A.S.A.P.</p>

                    <p>And lastly, one honorable mention: Project Arrythmia. While I haven't played a LOT of this game, I'd still say it stands out a lot as it's the only rhythm game that I can truly say has an insanely unique mechanic, which would be the fact that it focuses purely on bossfights. It's honestly all I could ever dream of; sick music, sick bossfights, what more can you want from a game? <br><br> I'd love to play more of it and I just might, writing this paragraph made me REALLY hungry for rhythm games</p>
