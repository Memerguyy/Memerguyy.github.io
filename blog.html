    <p>Wow, I got into status.cafe, kinda late on this info but yippee! I'm also working a bit more on the main site, I think I might do something about the "Other interests" section, since I do like my site being <u>INTERACTIVE</u> but I don't want it to be <i>OVERLOADED</i> if that makes sense. In essence, I just dont want a ton of scrolling to happen on my site. <br><br> if I do make future pages (and I definitely will), I'll put them into seperate links, for now though I'm feeling pretty happy, I did embeds for my site, worked on the index page to warn for the horribly optimized JS on this site, and next I think ill try to give a crack at.......... the Ahri shrine.... no idea how I'll even appraoch it but I'll manage (I think...)<br><br>Next on the roadmap as well is making a button for my site, I might commision a friend for it but I think trying to draw one myself is a fun challenge</p>

    <p>God, after a while I finished implementing in the ahri site, problem is though; it's cringe asl, I'm probably going to push it out to main along with this blog but the way to access it will be to just type in the url. I originally intended for it to just be accessed through the ahri painting on homepage but idk... <br><br>Also, it's less of a """shrine""" than it is just showing off all the s**t that I have for her, so skins and my mastery basically lol, I originally had a more intricate idea, it wouldve been a completely dark page, with an ahri ascii art at the front, then scrolling down you would've gotten to the sections about her... but I just dont really know how to make it uhhh... not boring I guess?<br><br>I'm probably gonna revamp it at some point to make it into what I actually want but as for now I think I'll just link the Ahri painting to my masteryChart, lol <br><br>One thing which sucks is that I spent like 2 days working on it (well in actuality it's probably more like 6-7 hours) because I had to learn some stuff in JS, but oh well, you live and you learn <br><br>GGTY, hopefully next time I'll do something cooler</p>

    <p>You know, I should really add some essence to my pages, some *PIZZAZ* if one will, because while I do love this aesthetic, there really should be something more... I guess diverse here... <br><br>I added a new html with a shrine dedicated to Ahri (W.I.P as I'm writing this) so I might switch it up there... idk though, but on the other hand I really love making and designing and learning webdev, I adore it, so I just might give it a shot</p>

    <p>Wow I can't believe this actually works, but anyways enough talk, lets speak (that sounded better in my mind). First of all, I will not be giving these a date because <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. f**k you<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. I'm too lazy<br><br>but if it gives you peace of mind, this first entry was made at around 2:17 am, 28/12/2023, CEST. Happy now? Good because I'm talking to myself. Anyways, I'm just gonna use this as a blog to write down stuff I guess, and let me start now. <br><br>"So why exactly all this?" I mean if you look at my github website history for f**k's sake you'll notice how my website changed from modern to something that looks like it was on neocities. Well in short: the internet today sucks ASS and I f***ing HATE IT!!! <br><br> "Modern" this "Modern" that how about you modern my f***ing ass, all this shit made us forget about the cool little websites that had cool little people on them and cool things to do, now its all just bland, I really wish I could go back to the 2000's, yeah, I <i>WOULD</i> lose a ton of convinience but is it worth it? yeah, life was much more simple. I really wanna go back to worrying about what I was gonna do in club penguin instead of now when all I have to worry about is... everything I guess. <br><br> <iframe width="400px" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1729448106%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-xVRrCnIr1Mb&color=%239c8c64&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe><br><br>In any case, this is the playlist I was listening to while making this site, I'll go f**k off now and do something else, probably more league, or 4chan, or both, or maybe my 2DS? Maybe I'll go and p- *dies* <br><br>GGTY, cya next time
