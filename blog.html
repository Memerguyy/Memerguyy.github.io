    <p>Wow I can't believe this actually works, but anyways enough talk, lets speak (that sounded better in my mind). First of all, I will not be giving these a date because <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. f**k you<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. I'm too lazy<br><br>but if it gives you peace of mind, this first entry was made at around 2:17 am, 28/12/2023, CEST. Happy now? Good because I'm talking to myself. Anyways, I'm just gonna use this as a blog to write down stuff I guess, and let me start now. <br><br>"So why exactly all this?" I mean if you look at my github website history for f**k's sake you'll notice how my website changed from modern to something that looks like it was on neocities. Well in short: the internet today sucks ASS and I f***ing HATE IT!!! <br><br> "Modern" this "Modern" that how about you modern my f***ing ass, all this shit made us forget about the cool little websites that had cool little people on them and cool things to do, now its all just bland, I really wish I could go back to the 2000's, yeah, I <i>WOULD</i> lose a ton of convinience but is it worth it? yeah, life was much more simple. I really wanna go back to worrying about what I was gonna do in club penguin instead of now when all I have to worry about is... everything I guess. <br><br> <iframe width="400px" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1729448106%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-xVRrCnIr1Mb&color=%239c8c64&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe><br><br>In any case, this is the playlist I was listening to while making this site, I'll go f**k off now and do something else, probably more league, or 4chan, or both, or maybe my 2DS? Maybe I'll go and p- *dies* <br><br>GGTY, cya next time
